                <h4>What personal data we collect</h4>
                <p>The only data we collect are the details you give us when you
                    sign up. This will include an email address, a name, the region you are in and a
                    message you type. We encourage and fully support anonymous contact!</p>
                <h4>Cookies</h4>
                <p>We don't set cookies.</p>
                <h4>Embedded content from other websites</h4>
                <p>Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g.
                    videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in
                    the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</p>
                <p>
                    These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional
                    third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content,
                    including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an
                    account and are logged in to that website.</p>
                <h4>Analytics</h4>
                <p>We don't do any!</p>
                <h4>Who we share your data with and how long we retain it</h4>
                <p>If you sign up using the contact form we will store that
                    data on Extinction Rebellion's community owned servers in a strongly encrypted
                    form. We do not (and will
                    never) share it with anyone else. If you wish that data to be deleted at some
                    later point, please <a href="/contact-us/">get in touch</a> and it will be done.</p>
