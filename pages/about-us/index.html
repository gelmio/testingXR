                <p class="huge" align=center>Extinction Rebellion is a global movement
                    that uses non-violent civil disobedience in an attempt to halt mass extinction
                    and minimise the risk of social collapse.</p>
                <h4>Our Story</h4>
                <p>On 31st October 2018, British activists assembled on Parliament Square in London
                    to announce a Declaration of Rebellion against the UK Government.  
                    The next few weeks were a whirlwind. Six thousand rebels converged on London to
                    peacefully block five major bridges across the Thames. Trees were planted in the
                    middle of Parliament Square, and hole was dug there to bury a coffin representing
                    our future. Rebels super-glued themselves to the gates of Buckingham Palace as
                    they read a letter to the Queen.</p>
                <p>Extinction Rebellion was born.</p>
                <p>The call to rebel swiftly became global, with branches
                    popping up the following week in Europe, the US, and soon after the world
                    over. Leaderless and truly global, each new branch makes the movement stronger, bringing in new perspectives,
                    wisdom, expertise, energy and inspiration.</p>
                <h4>So what's next?</h4>
                <p>We are working relentlessly, building our
                    movement in preparation for phase three, a global rebellion that will
                    begin on the 7th of October 2019. <strong>So come and <a href=../branches>join
                    us</a>. Rebel for life. For the planet.
                    For our children’s children’s futures. There is so much work to be
                    done.</strong>
