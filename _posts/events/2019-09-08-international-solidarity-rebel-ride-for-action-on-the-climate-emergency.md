Cities around the world are hosting bike rides for climate on September 8th. The XR MA chapter will meet to ride at 3pm and end with a picnic (around 5).

<!--more-->

XR non-biking families and friends are invited to join us for music and fun at the picnic. Spread the word!

We will meet on the Boston Common near the corner of Beacon and Charles St. We'll ride together at an easy pace (7-8 mph) and tour the major areas of downtown Boston, occasionally pausing to notice a high watermark for areas that will be underwater in a few years.

We return to the Common at around 5pm to meet with family and friends for a picnic (near Frog Pond on the Beacon St. Side). Bring your own food, snacks or sweets to share.
