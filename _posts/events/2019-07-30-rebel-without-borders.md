Life on Earth is experiencing an unprecedented global crisis: Scientists agree – we face flooding, forest fires, extreme weather conditions, crop failure and the collapse of societies. The time of denial is over. It is time to act.

Politics and conventional approaches to political engagement such as voting, lobbying, petitions and demonstrations fail to address this crisis. History shows us a promising, democratic means to bring about social change: nonviolent, civil disobedience.

From the 7th of October we will block cities through an international rebellion and thus halt everyday routines that destroy our livelihoods. Besides Berlin, Amsterdam, London, Paris and New York are at the center of the peaceful uprising. We will be thousands embarking on non-violent civil disobedience so that the government can finally respond appropriately to the climate crisis.

We will rebel together in streets and squares and remain there- peacefully, creatively and colorfully. Be part of it!
