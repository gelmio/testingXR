On August 24, Extinction Rebellion Sweden will carry out what they expect to be their biggest action yet. We’re going to flood the streets of Malmö!

This action is an important part of our strategy to force those in power to tell the truth about the scale of the climate and ecological emergency we face, and then to act accordingly to address it. It is also part of our build-up towards the October Rebellion.

The action will take place at several targets in the Malmö area, and the meeting point will be in Kungsparken at 11 am. There will be training available here for any newcomers and anyone else who needs refreshing! 

From there, everyone will split up into groups and swarm various locations around Malmö. At the end we join up for a groovy festival blockade near the sea – the exact location of which will be disclosed closer to the date. 

There will also be lots of music, arts, and fun! 

Camping will be set up nearby for those who wish to do so, and other accommodation will be available. Please see the separate accommodation post (to come). 

This Facebook event will be updated with more details regarding travel, training and other preparations. 

If you are able to participate, we urge you to plan to attend.
